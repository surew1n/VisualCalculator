===== Operation Algorithm =====

method ran from press of = button


two array lists - values, operators
values array will have 1 more index than operators

-------------------------------

for loop {
	iterate through the values list
	use the current index for the first number and operator, use the current index + 1 for the second number
}


if statements for operations

if (operation.equals("addition")) {
	current total + operation
}

values = {5, 1, 3, 7}
operators = {+, - , *}


===== Problems =====

// FIXED
for loop goes once, works fine
when i = 1, program crashes at line 21 out of bounds error as there is only one operation not 2
// FIXED
